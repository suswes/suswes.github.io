But sometimes I am a penguin Truthfully, I am a ctd in the shape of a penguin PhD in stuff. Active research in other stuff More details \u00b6 I founded Fluent.ai and grew it, in my role as Founder and CTO, from zero to a well-known provider of speech recognition systemss. At Fluent.ai, we developed cutting-edge machine learning techniques for offline, on-device voice user interfaces targetted at tinyML, low-power embedded devices, smart-home devices, and wearables. We used a unique end-to-end spoken language understanding system. Unlike conventional speech recognition systems [speech --> text --> intent], these models do not require the intermediate text step and are able able to directly go from speech to intent, much like humans.
