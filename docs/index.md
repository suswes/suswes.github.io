## Profile Summary
I am a research scientist excited about anything and everything happening in our gut. For 15 years I've navigated through 9 departments in 3 countries exploring questions about mucosal immunology, host-parasite interactions, the gut-brain-axis and the gut microbiota. My scientific roadtrip, although winding, is rooted in fundamental questions about how the environment communicates with our body. In my opinion, the essence of our body‚Äôs tolerance to the environment resides in multi-compartment communication between the immune system, stromal backbone and the gut microbiota. I look forward to establishing a research platform that will detangle this crosstalk to facilitate the development of multi-facted therapies against gastrointestinal disorders.
