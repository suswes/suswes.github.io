# Research Experience
## Postdoctoral Research Fellow	| 2020 - present
## Research Institute of McGill University Health Complex (RI-MUHC), Montreal, QC, Canada
### **Department of Microbiology and Immunology | Dr. Irah King‚Äôs Lab**
- Created and led a research project defining a novel role of type 1 immunity during intestinal damage
- Discovered that IFNùõæ bridges an immune-stromal cell axis to prevent tissue damage and reduce mortality in mice subjected to infection in a gut-microbiota dependent manner.
- Technical expertise in flow cytometry, bone marrow chimeras, adoptive transfer, genetic mouse models, primary cell cultures, intestinal organoids and stem cells, confocal imaging and in situ hybridization
- Led several collaborative multiparametric imaging and clinical immunophenotyping studies
- Duties included leadership roles, official mentorship, and teaching experience

## Postdoctoral Research Fellow | 2018 - 2020
## Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA
### **Department of Neurology | Dr. Giulio Pasinetti's Lab**
- Defined gut-brain-axis mechanisms exacerbating post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in mice
- Developed a probiotic formulation with optimized metabolite output driving an immunoregulatory state
- Built a microbiology lab and humanized model of the gastrointestinal tract from the bottom-up
- Collaborated on machine learning research for predicting relationships between gut microbiota populations, immune cell subsets and behavioral phenotypes to direct mechanistic-based hypotheses
- Duties included mentorship, IACUC and IRB protocol writing, collaborative projects in metabolomics and neuroimmunology, clinical sample work and program grant writing

## Co-founder & Vice President of Proviva Pharma Inc., | 2015 - 2018
### **Montreal, Canada**
- Spin-off company based on my Ph.D. work created with my supervisor focused on developing probiotic and prebiotic formulations with health claims for metabolic disorders and aging
- Filed an international patent and obtained operating permits in several countries
- Collaborated with manufacturers to customize probiotic products for Asian markets

## Research Assistant in the Department of Biochemistry | 2013 - 2014
### **Banaras Hindu University, Dr. Surya Pratap Singh‚Äôs lab; Varanasi India**
- Explored principles of alternative medicine to design novel treatment paradigms for Parkinson's disease
- Discovered therapeutic benefits of plant-based herbs acting through gut-brain-axis mechanisms

## Research Assistant at Genome Quebec Innovation Centre | 2012 - 2013
### **McGill University; Montreal, Canada**
- Developed a pipeline to identify epigenetic modifications in clinical samples using high-throughput, next-Generation sequencing technologies for MethylC-Seq, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq
- Created a foundation upon which several high-impact studies were published

## Undergraduate Researcher | 2007
- Department of Biomedical Engineering
- iGEM: International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition | MIT
- Group research leader for iGEM. We strove to engineer a robust quorum sensor in bacteria and to mathematically model this stochastic system for execution in Mathematica.
