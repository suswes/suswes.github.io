#### Research Institute of McGill University Health Complex (RI-MUHC), _Montreal, QC,_ Canada
**_Department of Microbiology and Immunology | Dr. Irah King‚Äôs Lab_**			
 - Created and led a research project defining a novel role of type 1 immunity during intestinal damage
- 
- Discovered that IFNùõæ bridges an immune-stromal cell axis to prevent tissue damage and reduce mortality in mice subjected to infection in a gut-microbiota dependent manner.
- Technical expertise in flow cytometry, bone marrow chimeras, adoptive transfer, genetic mouse models, primary cell cultures, intestinal organoids and stem cells, confocal imaging and in situ hybridization
- Led several collaborative multiparametric imaging and clinical immunophenotyping studies
- Duties included leadership roles, official mentorship, and teaching experience

#### Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, _New York, NY,_ USA	
**_Department of Neurology | Dr. Giulio Pasinetti's Lab_**
 - Defined gut-brain-axis mechanisms exacerbating post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in mice
 - Developed a probiotic formulation with optimized metabolite output driving an immunoregulatory state
 - Built a microbiology lab and humanized model of the gastrointestinal tract from the bottom-up
 - Collaborated on machine learning research for predicting relationships between gut microbiota populations, immune cell subsets and behavioral phenotypes to direct mechanistic-based hypotheses
 - Duties included mentorship, IACUC and IRB protocol writing, collaborative projects in metabolomics and neuroimmunology, clinical sample work and program grant writing

### Co-founder & Vice President of Proviva Pharma Inc | 2015 - 2018
**_Montreal, Canada_**
